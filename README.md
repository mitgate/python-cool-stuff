# Mathematical division that rounds down to nearest integer.

The floor division operator is //

For example, the expression 11 // 4 evaluates to 2 in contrast to the 2.75 returned by float true division.


- Python3:
```
print ( 11//4 )
# 2
print( 11/4 )
# 2.75
```
Note that (-11) // 4 is -3 because that is -2.75 rounded downward
```
print ( -11//4 )
# -3 
print ( -11/4 )
# -2.75 
```

- Python2:
```
print ( 11//4 )
# 2 
print ( 11/4 )
# 2 

print ( -11//4 )
# -3 
print ( -11/4 )
# -3 
```


# Combined multiply and assignment
```
somevar = '*' 
somevar *= 33
print(somevar)
# *********************************
```


# Some things Under the hood

The *= always calls __imul__ on the left hand operand :

```
product = [1] 
product *= 5
print ( product )
# [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
is equivalent to :
```
product = [1] 
product.__imul__(5)
print ( product )
# [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
```
# Tuple unpacking

Tuple unpacking allows you to just pass a tuple or list to a function that expects several positional arguments;
these then get unpacked accordingly. 

For example:
- Python3:
```
print(*[1, 2, 3, 4])
# 1 2 3 4 
print([1, 2, 3, 4]) 
# [1, 2, 3, 4] 
```
- Python2:
```
print(*[1, 2, 3, 4])
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax
print([1, 2, 3, 4]) 
# [1, 2, 3, 4]
```
